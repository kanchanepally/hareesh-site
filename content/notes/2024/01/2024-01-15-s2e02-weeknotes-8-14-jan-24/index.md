### Key Themes for the week

- Common to both professional and personal lives
    - Keep checking on the Values helps to be more intentional.
    
    - Presence - carried forward from the above, the day-to-day is already starting to distract and the presence - I hate to admit, took a bit of a brunt.
    
    - Other emergent theme in the work front is: Managing PgMs and setting out a clear set of expectations: Absolute Must for PgM
    
    - Finally, there was another theme of Definition of work for TPMs especially as Instagram asked a bunch of TPMs to re-apply as Product Managers.

- Specifically around personal life
    - Being an immigrant: we celebrated Sankranthi - inviting around 40 of our friends/their families and making some kites.

- Specifically around work
    - Prioritisation - on-going, and next steps for each initiative.
    
    - Networks, especially around/stretching into BigTech colleagues

### Key insights

- To be consistent during the busy times is the key to ensuring things don't just slip away. I would need to infuse other habits together to be more consistent and busy. Perhaps time to start walking meetings.

- While Consistency is key, it's not about perfection. It's about unwavering trend of showing up. It's a marathon rather than a sprint. Hiccups will be there, but the idea is to get back on the proverbial horse.

### What's in store for 15-21, Jan 24

- Continue working on the Goals for 2024 (professional at team and individual levels and personal level)

- Dad time while mummy is away for work

- Publish three posts and get more of a cadence

- Preparation for Product & Tech internal conference
