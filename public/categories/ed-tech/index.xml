The post first briefly defines LMS - explaining its origins, describing how it has been used, and elucidating the changing face of technology and learning theory.  It will then consider LMS’s failure to meet these changing needs, discusses the shifts to Personal Learning Networks, before finally listing some potential improvements that, if implemented, could provide a basis for repositioning LMS applications to achieve future success.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Exploration and Critique of the Arguments in Support of Using Twitter for Learning (An Essay)</title><link>https://hareesh.co/notes/2011/02/2011-02-26-twitter-for-learning/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Feb 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hareesh.co/notes/2011/02/2011-02-26-twitter-for-learning/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Tim Berners-Lee, while talking at the MIT Technology Review Emerging Technologies conference, recalled that, when he set out to develop the Web during 1990s, he envisioned a technology that could serve as ‘a collaborative medium, a place where we can all play; a place where can all meet, read and write’ (2004). Since the origination of the Mosaic Web browser in 1993 and the evolution of World Wide Web with the incremental features it gathered over the following years, which Tim O’Reilly cumulatively termed as Web 2.0 (Tim O’Reilly, 2005), Tim Berners-Lee’s vision of a collaborative medium became a reality. The Web has been ‘transformed from a static information medium to worldwide communication platform’ (Martin Ebner, Conrad Lienhardt, Matthias Rohs and Iris Meyer, 2010, pp. 92). The new affordances of Web that allowed users to contribute in ways of writing, posting photographs and videos, editing the existing information, building connections and making friends, etc, resulted in its rapid growth. For example, at the time of this writing, BlogPulse(2011) identified more than 154 million blogs, Facebook(2011) has more than 500 million active users, and Wikipedia(2011) is ebbing with 9.25 million articles in 250 languages. This growth in Web usage, the immediate dissemination of information, and manifold connections resulted in the so-called ‘network society’, a society whose social structure is made of networks powered by microelectronic-based information and communication technologies (Castells, M. 2004, pg. 4). The businesses took the advantage of these networked societies and went global, transforming the industrial economies into those based on knowledge and information. Eventually, this had direct and immediate impact on the&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Not Just Learners</title><link>https://hareesh.co/notes/2011/01/2011-01-01-not-just-learners/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hareesh.co/notes/2011/01/2011-01-01-not-just-learners/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Whether it is behavioral perspective (stimuli and response), cognitive ideology (organization or reorganization of concepts), or situative perspective (getting adjusted to the &amp;lsquo;constraints&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;affordances&amp;rsquo; of social systems), learning primarily involves a constant interplay between the individual and the environment the individual is part of. Individual is always within a context and learns out of or because of it. We are not talking of the needs that trigger learning, which might be entirely personal, but of the resources that facilitate learning. &lt;a href="http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?doi=94368&amp;amp;hl=1&amp;amp;q=Brigid%20Barron"&gt;Brigid Barron&lt;/a&gt;, an Asst. Prof. of Education at Stanford, while providing a learning ecology framework, graphically explains how technological development in learners is influenced by different contexts. The following image is inspired by (to be candid, drives a lot of content from) her presentation. However, the image below is not constrained only to learning  new technology. People learn from different sources irrespective of the subject. Though most of the contexts presented in the image are self-explanatory, &amp;lsquo;distributed resources&amp;rsquo; refer to books, articles, on-line communities, etc. And, these contexts are dynamic. Borders of each of the context might get blurred quite often and they might intersect with the others. However, the point here is that an individual interacts with these different resources when there is a need for knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
