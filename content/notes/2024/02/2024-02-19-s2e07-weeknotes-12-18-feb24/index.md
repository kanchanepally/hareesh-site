**Personal Reflections:**

It's gratifying to write for others, and I appreciate your readership. Last week, I started sharing my [fortnightly newsletter](https://open.substack.com/pub/hareesh/p/makara-sankranti-at-our-southwest?r=cmhoq&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) Des/Pardes more widely. Strangely enough, there's a duality of feeling: a feeling of self-indulgence balanced by a desire to share/be heard. The positive feedback from readers has been validating, and I'm committed to maintaining consistency while using writing to reflect on myself, the community, and our shared space.

This week also saw a renewed focus on coding practice, spcefically on control structures and efficient error handling. I firmly [believe](https://hareesh.co/beliefs/) that I have a lot to learn, and I don't think that drive will never fade. For anyone interested in diving into programming, I would definitely recommend one of the [HyperionDev bootcamps](https://www.hyperiondev.com/?utm_source=direct&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=earn_R2500&referral_code=NCBBNH6N) (if you sign up from the link, you get a 10% discount too!)

**Professional Strides:**

Performance appraisals occupied a significant portion of my work time. I view them as an opportunity to express gratitude to colleagues who consistently go the extra mile, and to explore ways to support their ambitions.

We're also tackling the complex challenge of planning and managing dependencies. While everyone acknowledges its importance, a solution that fits our context remains elusive.

**Looking Ahead:**

That essentially brings me to what lays ahead for the third week of Feb:

- Planning for and managing dependencies on core platform teams.

- Further actively marketing the [Des/Pardes](https://hareesh.substack.com?utm_source=navbar&utm_medium=web&r=cmhoq) newsletter. (Subscribe now!)

- Sharing the next post with technical programme managers on the [craft of execution](https://hareesh.co/tag/execution/).

See you next week!
