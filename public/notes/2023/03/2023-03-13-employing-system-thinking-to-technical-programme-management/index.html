Embarking on the integration of WeChat Pay for our Chinese customers was not just a project; it was a riveting exploration of dependencies, interconnections, and the intricate dance of technology in a dynamic ecosystem. This journey demanded more than conventional project management—it required a masterclass in systems thinking. In this playbook, we unravel the saga and distil the lessons learned into actionable insights for fellow technology program managers."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2023-03-13T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2023-03-13T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Agile"><meta property="article:tag" content="Delivery"><meta property="article:tag" content="Project-Management"><meta property="article:tag" content="Systems-Thinking"><meta property="article:tag" content="Technical-Programme-Management"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tpm"><meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:1313/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>Employing System Thinking to Technical Programme Management</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2023-03-13T00:00:00+00:00>March 13, 2023</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><figure><p><a href=https://hareesh.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pexels-photo-1472612.jpeg><figure><div class=img-container style=--w:1880;--h:1253><img loading=lazy alt src=/notes/2023/03/2023-03-13-employing-system-thinking-to-technical-programme-management/images/pexels-photo-1472612.jpeg width=1880 height=1253></div></figure></a></p><figcaption><p>Photo by Lina Mamone on <a href=https://www.pexels.com/photo/lighted-city-during-night-1472612/>Pexels.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Embarking on the integration of WeChat Pay for our Chinese customers was not just a project; it was a riveting exploration of dependencies, interconnections, and the intricate dance of technology in a dynamic ecosystem. This journey demanded more than conventional project management—it required a masterclass in systems thinking. In this playbook, we unravel the saga and distil the lessons learned into actionable insights for fellow technology program managers.</p><p><strong>Phase 1: Mapping the Interconnected Landscape</strong></p><p>Before diving headlong into the tumultuous waters, we took the time to meticulously chart our course:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Identify Stakeholders with Precision:</strong></p><ul><li>Legal experts, compliance specialists, tech virtuosos, and our customers were not merely roles; they were key players in our symphony. We delved into their goals, concerns, and interactions, recognizing their crucial roles in the success of the project.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Untangle the Web of Dependencies:</strong></p><ul><li>Beyond payment gateways like Stripe, our map revealed a complex web of regulatory constraints, currency fluctuations, and data privacy considerations. Each thread interconnected, influencing the trajectory of the others.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Challenge Siloed Vision:</strong></p><ul><li>Recognizing the limitations of siloed thinking, we orchestrated a cross-functional tango. Engineers, designers, and product leads waltzed out of their comfort zones, promoting a collaborative approach that transcended traditional boundaries.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Feedback System Dynamics:</strong></p><ul><li>Establish a structured feedback system that transcends individual opinions. Leverage tools that enable transparent communication, ensuring all team members are part of the continuous feedback loop.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Phase 2: Embracing the Chaos of Feedback Loops</strong></p><p>Having unveiled the intricacies of the landscape, we didn&rsquo;t shy away from the chaos; instead, we harnessed it:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Relentless Prototyping:</strong></p><ul><li>Rapid prototyping became our compass in navigating both the regulatory labyrinth and user expectations. Constant iteration allowed us to adapt swiftly to emerging challenges.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Leveraging Feedback as a Guiding Force:</strong></p><ul><li>Customer feedback and internal critiques were not just inputs; they were the conductors guiding our project orchestra. Every piece of feedback influenced our UI, user flow, and even marketing copy.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Dynamic Mental Model Adaptation:</strong></p><ul><li>Rigidity had no place in our project. Assumptions were treated like faulty code—discarded without hesitation. We embraced a culture of continuous learning, adjusting our mental models in response to evolving insights.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Holistic Metrics Integration:</strong></p><ul><li>Beyond traditional project metrics, integrate holistic measures that capture the overall health and success of the system. Consider factors like team morale, communication effectiveness, and adaptability as crucial indicators.</li></ul></li></ol><p><strong>Phase 3: Delivering Value – A Collaborative Triumph</strong></p><p>Emerging victorious after a month and a half, WeChat Pay thrived just in time for the peak season. Beyond the tangible success, our true triumph lay in the toolbox of lessons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Early Dependency Mapping:</strong></p><ul><li>Avoid the pitfalls of a waterfall approach. Identify and understand the interconnected forces at play before the project takes shape. Early mapping sets the stage for a more informed and agile execution.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Champion Feedback Loops:</strong></p><ul><li>Treat feedback loops not as nuisances but as vital components of project management. They guide you towards project harmony, steering you away from potential dissonance.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Challenge Mental Models Continuously:</strong></p><ul><li>Silos hinder innovation. Break them down by fostering cross-functional teams and revel in the collaborative beauty that arises from embracing the messiness of collective problem-solving.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Celebrate Complexity:</strong></p><ul><li>Instead of fearing the complexity inherent in interconnected systems, find joy in navigating the unexpected. Every challenge is an opportunity to learn and grow, contributing to the evolution of more customer-centric tech programs.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Continuous System Learning:</strong></p><ul><li>Foster a culture of continuous learning not only within individual teams but across the entire system. Establish forums for knowledge sharing, ensuring that insights gained in one corner of the project are disseminated throughout.</li></ul></li></ol><p>WeChat Pay served as a microcosm of our broader journey—a journey towards embracing systems thinking for agility, resilience, and, ultimately, customer-centricity in our technological pursuits. So, when faced with seemingly straightforward projects, remember that the most rewarding voyages often commence with a complex, interconnected dance. Grab your systems thinking compass, and let&rsquo;s navigate the intricacies together!</p></div></article><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
