**Intro - Management by Exception**

Micromanagement can stifle creativity and hinder progress. On the other hand, not supporting Programme Managers in effectively executing technical programmes and projects pro-actively could result in heavy losses. Over the last decade of managing technical programmes and managers, I developed a set of expectations building on the **Management by Exception** (MBE) principles. Embracing this philosophy for technical programme managers (T/PgMs) can empower them with clear expectations and autonomy, intervening only when necessary. This document outlines the "absolute musts" for T/PgMs using the MBE framework, with measurable tolerances and proactive measures to guide their actions and your monitoring.

- Strategic Alignment:
    - **Must-Do:** Articulate program alignment with organizational goals in PRDs, quarterly presentations, and monthly progress reports, using metric dashboards to demonstrate impact.
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Conduct bi-annual strategic reviews with senior leadership to ensure ongoing alignment and adjust program direction as needed.

- Effective Leadership:
    - **Must-Do:** Hold weekly team meetings with defined agendas and action items with due dates.
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Implement 360-degree feedback surveys quarterly to assess team engagement and leadership effectiveness. Initiate monthly team-building activities to foster open communication and collaboration.

- Planning and Control:
    - **Must-Do:** Develop a comprehensive program plan within 1 week of kick-off, including estimated timelines for all phases of the programme, resource allocation, and budget tolerances (+/-5% using the Cone of uncertainty principles).
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Conduct weekly progress reviews against the plan. Implement corrective actions within 24 hours of any deviation exceeding 10% of planned timeline or budget.

- Technical Leadership and Dependency Management:
    - **Must-Do:** Contribute to system design and maintain dependency maps updated weekly.
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Conduct monthly deep dives into technical dependencies with cross-functional teams, identifying and mitigating potential risks.

- Risk Management:
    - **Must-Do:** Maintain a centralized risk log with probability and impact scores for each risk. Update the log weekly and escalate critical risks (>80% probability, >50% impact) immediately.
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Conduct quarterly risk workshops with stakeholders to identify and prioritize emerging risks.

- Stakeholder Management:
    - **Must-Do:** Develop and maintain a stakeholder register with preferred communication channels. Engage stakeholders in monthly briefings and address concerns promptly.
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Anticipate potential stakeholder concerns and proactively communicate mitigation plans before issues arise. Conduct annual stakeholder satisfaction surveys.

- Change Management:
    - **Must-Do:** Establish a formal change management process with defined approval stages and communication channels.
    
    - **Proactive Action**: Assess the impact of all changes on stakeholders and the program before finalizing decisions. Communicate approved changes two weeks in advance through multiple channels.

- Finance Management:
    - **Must-Do:** Develop and manage the program budget, tracking actual costs against the plan weekly. Report any cost overruns exceeding 2% immediately.
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Conduct monthly variance analyses to identify spending trends and cost-saving opportunities. Propose alternative solutions to address potential budget overruns before they occur.

- Reporting and Documentation:
    - **Must-Do:** Establish a single source of truth for all program documentation, accessible to all authorized stakeholders. Generate concise and informative progress reports weekly, highlighting key metrics and objectives achieved.
    
    - **Proactive Action:** Review progress reports and meeting minutes for accuracy and consistency with program goals. Implement a document version control system to ensure clear audit trails.

**Behaviours:**

- Ensure all meetings have clear agendas and designated note-takers. Distribute meeting minutes with action items within 24 hours.

- Schedule regular 1:1 meetings with key stakeholders (product manager, engineering managers) to build relationships and address concerns.

- Be accessible and responsive to team members and stakeholders through designated channels. Proactively identify and communicate potential problems and risks within 24 hours of identification.

- Celebrate successes and milestones with the team through public recognition and team-building activities.

**Outcomes:**

By embracing MBE and empowering your PMs with these expectations and proactive approaches, you can expect:

- **Successful program delivery:** Programs are completed on time, within budget, and meet defined objectives and quality standards.

- **Effective risk management**: Risks are identified, assessed, and mitigated early, minimizing their impact on the program.

- **Stakeholder satisfaction:** Stakeholders are engaged, informed, and satisfied with the program's progress and outcomes

**Proactive Monitoring Techniques for Managing PgMs:**

- Schedule regular/weekly check-ins with T/PgMs to discuss progress, challenges, and potential roadblocks.

- Utilise real-time dashboards for visualizing key metrics, enabling quick identification of deviations.

- Establish feedback loops where team members and stakeholders can provide input on potential issues or improvements.

- Invest in ongoing training for T/PgMs to enhance their skills and empower them to proactively address challenges.
