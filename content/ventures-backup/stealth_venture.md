## Digital Sovereignty for Everyone

An early-stage hardware venture focused on true digital sovereignty - giving individuals complete ownership and control of their digital lives.

### The Vision

In a world where our data is constantly extracted, analyzed, and monetized by corporations and governments, we've lost agency over our digital selves. Current "privacy" solutions are bandaids on a fundamentally extractive system.

This project explores hardware-based approaches to genuine digital autonomy - infrastructure that puts individuals back in control.

### Current Status

**Early exploration phase.** Researching:
- Hardware architecture approaches
- Digital sovereignty protocols
- User needs and pain points
- Manufacturing and distribution models

**Timeline:** Aiming for public reveal in early 2026

### Why Hardware?

Software solutions can always be compromised, backdoored, or changed by external parties. Hardware provides a foundation for sovereignty that users can physically control and verify.

### Philosophy

This aligns with my broader work on digital empowerment. Just as MyDigitAlly gives parents agency through knowledge, this project aims to give individuals agency through infrastructure.
