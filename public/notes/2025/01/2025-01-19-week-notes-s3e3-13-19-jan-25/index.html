Tension is a constant in life. Whether it’s the pull between ambition and patience, work and family, or even silence and words—it’s always there. This week was about learning to navigate those tensions with grace and clarity, even when things felt overwhelming. What I realise is that while intent is and was there, the day-to-day structures and pressures - and as I wrote last week - the foundations matter so much. The key learning is that the foundations need to give space for the unexpected and also the life-long habits and charecteristics that make us individuals."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-01-19T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-01-19T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Family"><meta property="article:tag" content="Intentions"><meta property="article:tag" content="Life"><meta property="article:tag" content="Mental-Health"><meta property="article:tag" content="Mindfulness"><meta property="article:tag" content="New-Year"><meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:1313/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>Week notes, S3E3: 13 - 19 Jan, 25</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2025-01-19T00:00:00+00:00>January 19, 2025</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><h3 class=heading id=theme-finding-balance-in-tension><strong><strong>Theme: Finding Balance in Tension</strong></strong>

Whether it’s the pull between ambition and patience, work and family, or even silence and words—it’s always there. This week was about learning to navigate those tensions with grace and clarity, even when things felt overwhelming. What I realise is that while intent is and was there, the day-to-day structures and pressures - and as I wrote last week - the foundations matter so much. The key learning is that the foundations need to give space for the unexpected and also the life-long habits and charecteristics that make us individuals.</p><p><strong>Work: Bridging and Balancing</strong><br>The middle of January brought an influx of activity. With the office reopening in full swing, I spent two consecutive days on-site, focusing on relationship-building and operational clarity. Conversations with consultants and peers were energising, especially as we explored ways to influence positive change. The discussions circled around three key areas: refining our prioritisation framework, mobilising cross-functional teams, and addressing the RACI tensions between two PMOs. None of these challenges are new, but the solutions require fresh thinking and collaboration.</p><p>At the same time, I was wrapping up a significant programme of work and preparing for next week’s monthly business review. This balancing act—closing one chapter while setting up another—mirrored the larger tension of the week. How do you push forward while keeping the present in check? The answer seems to lie in small, deliberate actions.</p><p><strong>Personal: The Weight of Words</strong><br>This week’s biggest lesson came from home. Misalignment over schedules and expectations created friction that, in hindsight, could have been softened with more patience and perspective.</p><p>But conflict has a way of teaching you what no manual can: how much your reactions shape the narrative. I realised that even when someone else’s words feel unkind or unjustified, my response has the power to escalate or de-escalate the moment. It’s not about perfection—we’re all human—but about practicing awareness. Nevertheless, our week culminated in a proud moment watching our little one perform at a music concert. What a joy it is to see your offspring thrive and enjoy themselves.</p><p>On the flip side, my routines faltered. Running, journaling, and eating well all fell by the wayside. The week felt heavier, and I leaned too hard on sugar and convenience. Yet, by Sunday, a quiet recalibration emerged and found small ways to regain our rhythm.</p><p><strong>Tension as a Teacher</strong><br>If Week 1 was about making space and Week 2 about laying foundations, this week was about finding balance in tension. And, hindsight. Not everything will go to plan. There will be moments of friction, misalignment, and even failure. The question is how you respond—whether you let the tension pull you apart or use it as a bridge to something stronger.</p><p>Next week’s intention? <strong>&ldquo;Rebuilding Rhythm.&rdquo;</strong></p></div></article><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
