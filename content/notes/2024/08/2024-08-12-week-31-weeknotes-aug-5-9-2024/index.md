## **Work front**

During my last published #weeknotes, I mentioned about doing a 360-degree risk review of my portfolio of programmes and coming up with a list ahead of a leadership offsite. I feel I ought to share that here.

- Confusion amongst cross-functional delivery vs domain-based organisation structure.

- Confusion between iterative model of delivery vs stage-gates way of monitoring/governance

- Lack of end-to-end focus on product delivery from all the disciplines involves.

- Lack of aligned ways of working for the domain teams (an off-shoot of the second item above)

We discussed these issues and how they are slowing us down and came up with a set of actions to fix that. Coincidentally, [Scott Ambler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sambler/) (co-creator of Discipline Agile) published an [article](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/agile-community-shat-bed-scott-ambler-1npwc/?trackingId=jKnjj3hQRn78mzrRIVA%2F6g%3D%3D) just today that I thought summarises some of the causes of the above issues. I could hug him for writing this up! And I am sure most of the #TPMs can relate.

## Personal front

I am smashing through the fat -- literally -- and my [total diet replacement](https://www.england.nhs.uk/diabetes/treatment-care/diabetes-remission/) is starting to yield (or should I say "shedding") the results. I have lost 1.5 stone (10kg) in 1 month. And while it's plateauing, I hope that it will get me back to a health state. I am really looking forward to writing up the phenomenology of the diet replacement ;-p. I am sure you're eagerly looking forward to reading that thrilling read.

Summer has started, and we're having fun. Enjoying the days: whether the sun's out or not. Camping, sailing, watching movies, joining in village parades, and the lot.

## Next week

It's hard to get back to work after holidays, but am super pumped with the insights from the leadership off-site, things to get through ahead of 2025 budget cycle, and oh yeah, writing a thing or two about the racist riots that the UK has seen in the last few days!

Cheerio, see you next Monday!
