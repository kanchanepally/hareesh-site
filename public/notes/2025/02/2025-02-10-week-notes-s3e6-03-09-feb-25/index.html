Another week ticked by. February’s gaining momentum, and it feels like a time for both consolidation and intentional movement. This week has been about bringing things into focus, both at work and at home.
At work, it’s been a week of clarity through consolidation. Sometimes, the sheer volume of projects can feel like a fog. This week was about cutting through that, taking a portfolio-level view. Status, risks, resources – getting it all down, sorting it out. It’s the unglamorous but essential work of leadership. The prep work that allows for deeper conversations. That conversation happened with product leadership this week, surfacing key decisions, pushing forward on crucial areas. Still more to do, always, but feeling like we cleared some ground and defined the path ahead, even if just a little. And equally important, connecting with the teams on the ground, understanding their perspectives, aligning intentions on how we work. It’s the connection that matters as much as the plan."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2025-02-10T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2025-02-10T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Family"><meta property="article:tag" content="Health"><meta property="article:tag" content="Intentions"><meta property="article:tag" content="Life"><meta property="article:tag" content="Mental-Health"><meta property="article:tag" content="Mindfulness"><meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:1313/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>Week notes, S3E6: 03 - 09 Feb, 25</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2025-02-10T00:00:00+00:00>February 10, 2025</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><h3 class=heading id=theme-consolidation-connection-and-tiny-steps><strong><strong>Theme: Consolidation, Connection, and Tiny Steps</strong></strong>

It’s the connection that matters as much as the plan.</p><p>Home front – <strong>connection and slow repair.</strong> Relationship work continues, a slow, steady process of learning and… unlearning. It&rsquo;s about understanding the patterns, the drivers, the things we often miss in the rush of day-to-day. Learning about myself, yes, but more importantly, learning about <em>us</em>. And how to communicate, truly communicate, beneath the surface noise. Then, the weekend – fully immersed in my son’s world. Friends visiting, long walks, the house filled with laughter and energy. Hard work, yes, in the way that hosting always is. But that warmth, that sense of belonging… that’s the fuel, isn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>Finances – <strong>eyes on the horizon.</strong> Still watchful. Still aiming for that mindful month-end. Small daily acts of discipline adding up, I hope, to a feeling of control.</p><p>Fun? Nordic Noir on the screen – atmospheric, brooding, a different kind of escape. And ironically, perhaps, reviewing January, setting intentions for February. Even that, the act of reflection, felt… grounding. A different kind of “fun,” maybe, but valuable nonetheless. Connecting back to that <a href=https://hareesh.co/2025/02/03/jan-2025-summary-monthnotes/>Jan 2025 Summary | Monthnotes</a> review, to those intentions, feels important. It’s about not just drifting, but steering, even subtly.</p><p>Health… still a whisper, not a shout. The running shoes are still waiting. But tomorrow, the plan is to lace them up. Small steps. Consistent steps.</p><p>This week wasn&rsquo;t about grand gestures. It was about <strong>consolidation, connection, and those tiny, intentional steps forward.</strong> At work, at home, within myself. It&rsquo;s the small adjustments to the wheel, as January reminded me, that hopefully, will lead to a smoother ride in the weeks ahead.</p></div></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2025/02/2025-02-03-jan-2025-summary-monthnotes/>Jan 2025 Summary | Monthnotes</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2025/the-impossible-job-of-digital-parenting/>The Impossible Job of Digital Parenting</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
