Now, however, we all know that self-reflection is something we &amp;ldquo;need to&amp;rdquo; do, &amp;ldquo;love to&amp;rdquo; do, but at least in my case, never do it enough and/or consistently. Coincidentally, I have been a fan of the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jonnyfwilliams/comweeknotes-2-6-january-22d7517e6ec2"&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jonnyfwilliams"&gt;Jonny Williams&lt;/a&gt; has been publishing throughout the last year and I found them a useful format to not only reflect but to share the notes from the world. There&amp;rsquo;s intentionality in it and also a social commitment that I love. So, here we go: here&amp;rsquo;s the first of the 2023! Oh, wishing you a happy new year, by the way (if I can still wish you on the 09th of Jan).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Preparing for First Trail Marathon</title><link>https://hareesh.co/notes/2016/01/2016-01-12-preparing-for-first-trail-marathon/</link><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hareesh.co/notes/2016/01/2016-01-12-preparing-for-first-trail-marathon/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have &lt;em&gt;not yet&lt;/em&gt; run a marathon. I am preparing to run my first marathon in 2016, here in the U.K. I am not sure I will want to continue participating in races later on,  or may be continue on to ultra-marathons, but nothing yet planned. So, given that scope and context, the following posts are a collection of information fundamentally for my own preparation. I will publish each post as I learn and train.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
