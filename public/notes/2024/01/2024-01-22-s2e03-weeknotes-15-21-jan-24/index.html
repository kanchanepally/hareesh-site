Living Intently: Reflection, Thought, Choice#Key Themes this week:#This week, the juggle became real. Work and life intertwined, both echoing themes of attention, care, and intention. Yet, a subtle shift felt like sand slipping through my fingers – the descent from conscious action to reactive busyness.
Work meetings consumed mental resources, making my daily journal an uphill battle. Yet, the irony – amidst that struggle, I became a prolific work-related writer! I engaged with professional content, captured thoughts on product delivery must-haves, and penned a passionate defence of dates and estimates as valuable tools, not shackles. Perhaps the key lies in understanding those “must-do"s. Are they internal expectations, the siren call of proving my worth, or external demands I readily embrace? Next week, I aim to untangle their source and prioritize with greater intention.'><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-01-22T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-01-22T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Weeknotes"><meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:1313/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>S2E03 #WeekNotes 15-21 Jan '24</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2024-01-22T00:00:00+00:00>January 22, 2024</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><figure><p><a href=https://hareesh.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/pexels-photo-277593.jpeg><figure><div class=img-container style=--w:1880;--h:1003><img loading=lazy alt src=/notes/2024/01/2024-01-22-s2e03-weeknotes-15-21-jan-24/images/pexels-photo-277593.jpeg width=1880 height=1003></div></figure></a></p><figcaption><p>Photo by Pixabay on <a href=https://www.pexels.com/photo/seven-white-closed-doors-277593/>Pexels.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><h2 class=heading id=living-intently-reflection-thought-choice>Living Intently: Reflection, Thought, Choice

Next week, I aim to untangle their source and prioritize with greater intention.</p><p>Speaking of which, my son and I revelled in our &ldquo;Dad&rsquo;s turn&rdquo; week. We devoured books, unleashed our inner writers, and laughed until our bellies ached with Minions. These wins – the joy of fatherhood, the courage to stand up for my team, the connection with peers on LinkedIn, and the triumphant vanquishing of writer&rsquo;s block – illuminate the power of embracing present moments.</p><h3 class=heading id=whats-in-store-for-22-28-jan-24>What&rsquo;s in store for 22-28, Jan 24:
<a class=anchor href=#whats-in-store-for-22-28-jan-24>#</a></h3><p>However, personal and professional goals deserve distinct spotlights. Next week, my professional lens focuses on the realm of product development and strategic execution. I&rsquo;ll dissect job titles, untangle work phases, and map out responsibilities. Identifying where value resides amidst financial pressures – a question gnawing at every company seeking efficiency – is the critical puzzle piece. As individuals, this quest echoes within us. What value do we bring to our company, role, and society? I&rsquo;ll dedicate time to ponder that and seek clarity beyond job titles.</p><p>Finally, coding beckons me back. My quantifiable target? Four tasks conquered, line by line. Each keystroke a deliberate choice, a step towards mastery, a testament to reclaiming intentional living.</p><p>Next week, the theme is &ldquo;Intentionality in Action.&rdquo; Reflection, thought, and choice will be my compass, guiding me through busyness, embracing wins, and carving a path towards personal and professional fulfilment. The journey starts now, with a deep breath and an open mind.</p><p>Join me, won&rsquo;t you? What will your theme of intentionality be? Share your thoughts in the comments below, and let&rsquo;s make this week a masterpiece of conscious living.</p></div></article><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
