New years don’t start with fireworks (well, ours did—with gentle Rainbow crackers to welcome the year); they start with clearing space. Four bags to Oxfam, a trip to the recycling centre, and a freshly deep-cleaned home weren’t just tasks. They were declarations: “This is the past. Now, I’m making room for what’s next.”

But space isn’t only physical. It’s emotional, relational, and mental. Hosting an old friend this week during the new year celebration brought joy, nostalgia—and a bit of tension. Yet, often the best response is to simply hold space. Not everything needs a resolution. Sometimes, it’s enough to just be present.

**Momentum in the Small Things**

Progress rarely comes from grand gestures. This week, it looked like a sunny walk on the moors, an 8km run, and a quiet family swim at the local pool. None of these moments are headline-worthy, but they create momentum, brought us together, and marked our holiday break. They remind you that growth is built in the margins, not the spotlight.

**The Stories We Choose**

The hardest part of the week? Remembering. Days blur fast, even meaningful ones. I’ve realised that capturing the story of a day—whether through a journal entry, a photo, or even a quick note—matters. It’s not just about keeping track. It’s about grounding yourself in what happened, so you can carry it forward.

**Work, Shifting Like Sand**

Work feels like stepping into a new job without leaving the old one. A new CEO, a new interim CTO, and my boss’s return from maternity leave—all in the same season. It’s an influx of change, bringing euphoria, excitement, and a tinge of anxiety. What will this shifting landscape demand? What challenges might emerge? I don’t have the answers yet, but the energy is palpable.

**What We Carry Forward**

This week reminded me that life isn’t about having all the answers; it’s about making space for the questions. Whether it’s decluttering your home, navigating relationships, or embracing workplace change, the goal isn’t to get it all perfect. It’s to stay curious, keep moving, and pay attention to the small moments that build something bigger.

Because progress isn’t tidy—it’s the space you make for it to unfold.

So the theme for Week 1 of 2025 has been, "making space".

I go into Week 2 with the intent to "lay steady foundations".

**Happy New Year!**
