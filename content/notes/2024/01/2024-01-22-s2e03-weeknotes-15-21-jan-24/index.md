## Living Intently: Reflection, Thought, Choice

### Key Themes this week:

This week, the juggle became real. Work and life intertwined, both echoing themes of attention, care, and intention. Yet, a subtle shift felt like sand slipping through my fingers – the descent from conscious action to reactive busyness.

Work meetings consumed mental resources, making my daily journal an uphill battle. Yet, the irony – amidst that struggle, I became a prolific work-related writer! I engaged with professional content, captured thoughts on product delivery must-haves, and penned a passionate defence of dates and estimates as valuable tools, not shackles. Perhaps the key lies in understanding those "must-do"s. Are they internal expectations, the siren call of proving my worth, or external demands I readily embrace? Next week, I aim to untangle their source and prioritize with greater intention.

Speaking of which, my son and I revelled in our "Dad's turn" week. We devoured books, unleashed our inner writers, and laughed until our bellies ached with Minions. These wins – the joy of fatherhood, the courage to stand up for my team, the connection with peers on LinkedIn, and the triumphant vanquishing of writer's block – illuminate the power of embracing present moments.

### What's in store for 22-28, Jan 24:

However, personal and professional goals deserve distinct spotlights. Next week, my professional lens focuses on the realm of product development and strategic execution. I'll dissect job titles, untangle work phases, and map out responsibilities. Identifying where value resides amidst financial pressures – a question gnawing at every company seeking efficiency – is the critical puzzle piece. As individuals, this quest echoes within us. What value do we bring to our company, role, and society? I'll dedicate time to ponder that and seek clarity beyond job titles.

Finally, coding beckons me back. My quantifiable target? Four tasks conquered, line by line. Each keystroke a deliberate choice, a step towards mastery, a testament to reclaiming intentional living.

Next week, the theme is "Intentionality in Action." Reflection, thought, and choice will be my compass, guiding me through busyness, embracing wins, and carving a path towards personal and professional fulfilment. The journey starts now, with a deep breath and an open mind.

Join me, won't you? What will your theme of intentionality be? Share your thoughts in the comments below, and let's make this week a masterpiece of conscious living.
