## Expert Generalist

I'm a Portfolio Director, founder, and builder focused on creating tools that empower people in the digital age.

### What I Do

**By Day:** I lead product portfolios in agile delivery environments, focusing on prioritization, strategy, and rapid execution. My role centers on getting the right things delivered quickly - balancing stakeholder needs, technical constraints, and business goals.

**By Night:** I build ventures at the intersection of technology, education, and digital sovereignty:
- **MyDigitAlly** - Empowering non-tech parents to confidently guide their children through the digital world
- **Stealth Project** - Exploring hardware solutions for digital sovereignty (revealing early 2026)

### Approach

I believe in:
- **Building in public** - Sharing the journey, not just the outcomes
- **Digital sovereignty** - True ownership of our digital lives
- **AI-assisted development** - Leveraging tools to move faster
- **Shipping imperfectly and iterating** - Done is better than perfect
- **The portfolio approach** - Multiple projects, diverse skills, interconnected growth

### Background

I've spent my career in technology portfolio management and product development, leading teams to deliver complex projects in agile environments. I'm interested in the intersection of technology, parenting, privacy, and how we can build tools that give people more agency over their digital lives.

I use AI-assisted development and "vibe coding" to rapidly prototype and build. Obsidian is my digital garden where ideas grow before they become ventures.

### Outside Work

I'm interested in entrepreneurship and constantly exploring ways to realize and monetize ideas that can make a meaningful impact.
