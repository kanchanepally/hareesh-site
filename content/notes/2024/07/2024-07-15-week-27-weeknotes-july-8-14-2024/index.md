Despite the ongoing struggle to wrangle weekly updates, I'm back in the saddle again. Persistence, it seems, is the key to consistent victories, both in writing and in life.

**Work Front: The Enterprise Software Development Rollercoaster**

Persistence rings especially true in my work in product development and delivery. I continue to grapple with a set of issues that, over my 15-year career, feel both repetitive and wicked. These challenges, while engaging and intellectually stimulating, follow a cyclical pattern: a period of rapid development to meet immediate revenue goals, followed by a phase of simplification and unification. Build, then tidy—rinse and repeat.

Enterprise architecture has evolved significantly, offering hope that we can break this cycle and create software that's both profitable, sustainable, and scalable. While iterative development churns out features, the architectural engine should propel us forward.

The "wickedness" of these problems lies in their complexity, interconnectedness, and lack of clear-cut solutions. Yet, despite their uniqueness, they also feel repetitive, rooted in the specific context and culture of enterprise software development.

My approach? Persistence, reflection, learning, and leaning in. Constantly zooming in and out, like a camera lens, helps me balance managing the repetitive cycle with tackling the unique challenges on the ground.

**Personal Front: Embracing the TDR and Literary Delights**

I took a couple of days off work to kickstart a total diet replacement (TDR) plan aimed at reversing my diabetes and halting peripheral neuropathy. In simpler terms, I've put on a bit too much weight, and it's time for a change. Surprisingly, the 800-calorie-per-day diet is manageable, especially with the help of excellent decaf black coffee.

This new regime, along with a minor unrelated procedure, gave me an excuse to indulge in my love of reading. Working for a publisher provides access to an incredible variety of books, and I thoroughly enjoyed delving into the techniques of autofiction and literary theory—not too far removed from the theater of software development!

**Coming Week: Risk Assessment and Ruminations on Food**

This week, I'll be conducting a 360-degree risk assessment of my portfolio and brainstorming mitigation strategies ahead of an LT workshop. On the personal front, I'll likely be ruminating on the joys (and challenges) of an 800-calorie diet!

Let's see what the next week brings!
