I have _not yet_ run a marathon. I am preparing to run my first marathon in 2016, here in the U.K. I am not sure I will want to continue participating in races later on,  or may be continue on to ultra-marathons, but nothing yet planned. So, given that scope and context, the following posts are a collection of information fundamentally for my own preparation. I will publish each post as I learn and train.

Whenever I prepare for an exam or interview, I make notes as I read through a number of resources and practice mock-tests. It helps me structure my thinking and aids me in remember stuff in a logical order. Sharing those personal training notes here serves a secondary purpose of helping other first-timers in navigating a plethora of information on marathon running. Also, I think it might be used to gain some feedback from experienced and build on their words of wisdom.

So, here they are - all the (future) posts. As I publish a post, I will add a hyperlink to it below. Please leave a comment to suggest anything I missed and should focus on learning.
