 The Illusion of Control
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#the-illusion-of-control"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We live in a world of digital convenience, but recent events have exposed the fragility of the infrastructure that underpins our online lives. The massive AWS outage that took down a significant portion of the internet was a stark reminder that we&amp;rsquo;ve entrusted our digital existence to a handful of centralized platforms. When they fail, we&amp;rsquo;re left powerless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dependence creates an illusion of control. We believe our data is safe, our conversations are private, and our digital lives are our own. But the reality is, we&amp;rsquo;re building our digital homes on rented land, and the landlord can change the terms at any moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Impossible Job of Digital Parenting</title><link>http://localhost:1313/notes/the-impossible-job-of-digital-parenting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/notes/the-impossible-job-of-digital-parenting/</guid><description>&lt;h2 class="heading" id="the-knowledge-gap"&gt;
 The Knowledge Gap
 &lt;a class="anchor" href="#the-knowledge-gap"&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parenting has always been challenging, but today&amp;rsquo;s parents face a unique and often overwhelming hurdle: the digital world. You&amp;rsquo;re expected to guide your children through a complex landscape of apps, games, and social platforms that are constantly changing, all while feeling like you&amp;rsquo;re several steps behind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever felt lost, confused, or even a little scared when your child asks about a new app you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard of, you&amp;rsquo;re not alone. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a personal failing; it&amp;rsquo;s a systemic problem. The pace of technological change has created a &amp;ldquo;knowledge gap&amp;rdquo; between parents and their digitally native children, and it&amp;rsquo;s leaving parents feeling powerless.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
