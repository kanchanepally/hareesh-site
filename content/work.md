## Technology Portfolio Director

I lead the entire product development lifecycle for a portfolio of ~30 digital products, from strategic selection and annual budgeting to hands-on execution and delivery. As an expert generalist, I connect 30,000-foot business strategy with ground-level team execution to deliver platforms that serve millions of users globally.

At my paid work, I currently focus on - broadly speaking - three core areas:

*   **Portfolio & Programme Leadership:** I direct multi-year product roadmaps, manage integrated planning across product and engineering, and lead the annual budgeting process for a portfolio valued at over £40M.

*   **AI Transformation:** I lead organization-wide AI adoption, working closely with L&D to develop role-based and department-specific transformation plans that integrate AI into our product development and operational workflows.

*   **Product & Team Leadership:** I build and enable global delivery teams to ship products that meet customer needs and business goals. I have a track record of delivering complex, business-critical platforms on time and on budget.
