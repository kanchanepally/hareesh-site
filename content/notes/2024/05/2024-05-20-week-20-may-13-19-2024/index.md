Another whirl-wind of a week with lots packed in. Let's jump right-in.

## Work

Generalizations are super easy, and we like to theorize and come up with very assured plans or "solutions" to some of our wicked problems. I am going to generalize a bit now, but by saying how easy it is to do, I ask you to consider this theory with a disclaimer, a caution, and as my opinion, inviting you to share yours. So, here's my theory about the current problems we face in product development/delivery:

Two main decisions: a) how we shape/cut our work and b) how we define our "teams" in turn define the rest of our whole charade: the ways of working, planning/delivery/running cadence, and communication patterns we use to realize value.

I will take a pause, re-read that, and review going forward. But last week at work, I had recurrent conversations about:

- How we mobilize for "quick"/"speedy" delivery

- How we enable ways of working so they're clear, efficient, and enable smooth delivery

- How program managers can be effective in enabling this conversation/cadence

- How our finances get arranged, accounted for, and attributed for value

- What an end-to-end BA is and how they help/work alongside Product Managers, Enterprise Architects, and Engineering Managers (what's the RACI ;-))

And so on...

It felt like all these conversations were just surface turbulences with strong root causes underneath, and my theory is that those two questions are at the heart of it all.

Are we in a continuous delivery mode with incremental delivery and feature factories, or are we shaping/spinning up new bets as "programmes" and "projects" that have costs/benefits/schedules/resources associated with them specifically? Are our "teams" domain/specialism-specific, or are they program-focused?

Apart from these very fruitful conversations, I had a fabulous evening dinner with my CTO at [Gee's](https://www.geesrestaurant.co.uk/) opposite where I studied - my geez - 14 yrs ago.

## Life

Am still grappling with the hand fracture that's taking forever. I am told it's going to be at least 6 more weeks! Nuisance. And my diabetes remission also not going to start for a while! I just wish things are a bit faster :-D

But again, thoroughly thrilled to be part of an amazing sailing club and can't wait to flex my sailing muscles soon.

## **Next week**

At work, I am going to continue focusing on the above but mainly on the spheres of how we get the work scheduled for next week and how we set up our teams, while continuing to push through the remainder of H1 deliverables. From the personal front, can't wait for our first wild camp of 2024!

Cheerio!
