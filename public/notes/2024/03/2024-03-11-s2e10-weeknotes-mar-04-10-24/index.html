Looking back on the week, it’s been a whirlwind of activity both professionally and personally. Let’s dive into the highlights:
Professional Reflections:
As you know, the economic landscape has been undergoing some seismic shifts lately. With the end of the era of “free money” and the closure of zero interest rate policies, businesses are feeling the squeeze. In the tech industry, where costs often took a backseat to other revenue streams, there’s now a renewed focus on the bottom line. The talk of the town revolves around layoffs, potential recessions, and the need for prudent financial management."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-03-11T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-03-11T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Agile"><meta property="article:tag" content="Governance"><meta property="article:tag" content="Intentions"><meta property="article:tag" content="Leadership"><meta property="article:tag" content="Product"><meta property="article:tag" content="Programme-Management"><meta property="og:image" content="https://hareesh.co/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>S2E10 #Weeknotes Mar 04-10 '24</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2024-03-11T00:00:00+00:00>March 11, 2024</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><figure><p><a href=https://hareesh.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pexels-photo-783725.jpeg><figure><div class=img-container style=--w:1880;--h:1254><img loading=lazy alt src=/notes/2024/03/2024-03-11-s2e10-weeknotes-mar-04-10-24/images/pexels-photo-783725.jpeg width=1880 height=1254></div></figure></a></p><figcaption><p>Photo by Todoran Bogdan on <a href=https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-on-beach-during-golden-hour-783725/>Pexels.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Looking back on the week, it&rsquo;s been a whirlwind of activity both professionally and personally. Let&rsquo;s dive into the highlights:</p><p><strong>Professional Reflections:</strong></p><p>As you know, the economic landscape has been undergoing some seismic shifts lately. With the end of the era of &ldquo;free money&rdquo; and the closure of zero interest rate policies, businesses are feeling the squeeze. In the tech industry, where costs often took a backseat to other revenue streams, there&rsquo;s now a renewed focus on the bottom line. The talk of the town revolves around layoffs, potential recessions, and the need for prudent financial management.</p><p>In the midst of this uncertainty, companies like Apple stand out for their steadfast commitment to simplicity and quality. This week at work, we&rsquo;ve been delving deep into discussions about our core focus and how to align our efforts for sustained growth. Long sessions with the product team and strategic planning exercises have been the order of the day as we chart our course forward in these challenging times.</p><p><strong>Personal Reflections:</strong></p><p>On a personal note, this week has been a time for (a similar) introspection. I&rsquo;ve come to realize that in my quest for knowledge and experience, I&rsquo;ve been spreading myself too thin. It&rsquo;s as if I&rsquo;ve been afraid of &ldquo;cornering myself&rdquo;, constantly keeping my options open. But in doing so, I realise I am missing out on the depth, the focus.</p><p>So, I&rsquo;m making a conscious effort to dial it back and focus on my core values and interests. It&rsquo;s about finding that balance between exploration and staying true to myself. As I look ahead to the coming weeks, I&rsquo;m excited to keep this newfound clarity front and centre, both in my professional endeavours and in my personal life.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s to a week of focus and growth ahead. See you on the other side!</p></div></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2024/03/2024-03-04-s2e09-weeknotes-feb-26-mar-03-24/>S2E09 #Weeknotes Feb 26-Mar 03, '24</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2024/03/2024-03-18-s2e11-weeknotes-mar-11-17-24/>S2E11 #Weeknotes Mar 11-17 '24</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
