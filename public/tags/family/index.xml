&lt;p&gt;Another week ticked by. February&amp;rsquo;s gaining momentum, and it feels like a time for both consolidation and intentional movement. This week has been about bringing things into focus, both at work and at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At work, it’s been a week of &lt;strong&gt;clarity through consolidation.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes, the sheer volume of projects can feel like a fog. This week was about cutting through that, taking a portfolio-level view. Status, risks, resources – getting it all down, sorting it out. It’s the unglamorous but essential work of leadership. The prep work that allows for deeper conversations. That conversation happened with product leadership this week, surfacing key decisions, pushing forward on crucial areas. Still more to do, always, but feeling like we cleared some ground and defined the path ahead, even if just a little. And equally important, connecting with the teams on the ground, understanding &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; perspectives, aligning intentions on how we work. It’s the connection that matters as much as the plan.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Week notes, S3E3: 13 - 19 Jan, 25</title><link>https://hareesh.co/notes/2025/01/2025-01-19-week-notes-s3e3-13-19-jan-25/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hareesh.co/notes/2025/01/2025-01-19-week-notes-s3e3-13-19-jan-25/</guid><description>&lt;h3 class="heading" id="theme-finding-balance-in-tension"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tension is a constant in life. Whether it’s the pull between ambition and patience, work and family, or even silence and words—it’s always there. This week was about learning to navigate those tensions with grace and clarity, even when things felt overwhelming. What I realise is that while intent is and was there, the day-to-day structures and pressures - and as I wrote last week - the foundations matter so much. The key learning is that the foundations need to give space for the unexpected and also the life-long habits and charecteristics that make us individuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Week notes, S3E2: 06 - 12 Jan, 25</title><link>https://hareesh.co/notes/2025/01/2025-01-12-week-notes-s2e2-06-12-jan-25/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hareesh.co/notes/2025/01/2025-01-12-week-notes-s2e2-06-12-jan-25/</guid><description>&lt;h3 class="heading" id="theme-laying-steady-foundations"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New beginnings are exciting, but they’re also delicate. The second week of the year wasn’t about grand leaps forward—it was about setting the groundwork, brick by brick, for what’s to come. The focus was on building clarity, momentum, and alignment—both at work and home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Work: Clarifying the Blueprint&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At work, the new year began in earnest, and with it, the complexity of a programme that spans two PMOs, each with overlapping accountabilities. RACI models are great on paper, but when two sets of leaders and structures coexist, clarity doesn’t emerge without effort. The week was dedicated to mapping out roles and responsibilities and ensuring alignment across teams. It felt less like a sprint and more like laying steady planks across a gap, one meeting and one conversation at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
