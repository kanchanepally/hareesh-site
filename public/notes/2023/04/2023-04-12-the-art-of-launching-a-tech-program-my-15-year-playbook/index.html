Fifteen years ago, a simple question from my boss ignited a flame that still burns bright: “Can you make this idea fly?” That “idea” became my first foray into the exhilarating world of technical program management (TPM), a journey that has since woven its way through over 40 tech projects and a dozen intricate, multi-team programs. From nimble startups to sprawling enterprises, I’ve learned that while contexts may differ, the bedrock of success lies in a meticulous “set-up” phase. This isn’t a rigid checklist, but rather a playbook honed through experience, designed to de-risk delivery and unlock early learning. So, gather around, fellow journeymen, and let’s delve into the secrets that unlock high-flying tech programs."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2023-04-12T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2023-04-12T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Agile"><meta property="article:tag" content="Delivery"><meta property="article:tag" content="Project-Management"><meta property="article:tag" content="Technical-Programme-Management"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tpm"><meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:1313/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>The Art of Launching a Tech Program: My 15-Year Playbook</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2023-04-12T00:00:00+00:00>April 12, 2023</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><figure><p><a href=https://hareesh.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/spot-runs-start-la.jpg><figure><div class=img-container style=--w:1880;--h:1255><img loading=lazy alt src=/notes/2023/04/2023-04-12-the-art-of-launching-a-tech-program-my-15-year-playbook/images/spot-runs-start-la.jpg width=1880 height=1255></div></figure></a></p><figcaption><p>Photo by Pixabay on <a href=https://www.pexels.com/photo/athletes-running-on-track-and-field-oval-in-grayscale-photography-34514/>Pexels.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Fifteen years ago, a simple question from my boss ignited a flame that still burns bright: &ldquo;Can you make this idea fly?&rdquo; That &ldquo;idea&rdquo; became my first foray into the exhilarating world of technical program management (TPM), a journey that has since woven its way through over 40 tech projects and a dozen intricate, multi-team programs. From nimble startups to sprawling enterprises, I&rsquo;ve learned that while contexts may differ, the bedrock of success lies in a meticulous &ldquo;set-up&rdquo; phase. This isn&rsquo;t a rigid checklist, but rather a playbook honed through experience, designed to de-risk delivery and unlock early learning. So, gather around, fellow journeymen, and let&rsquo;s delve into the secrets that unlock high-flying tech programs.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Mapping the Human Landscape - Stakeholders and Their &ldquo;Why&rdquo;</strong></p><p>First, we lay the foundation with <strong>deep stakeholder understanding</strong>. Think of it as an intricate map, where each dot represents a person impacted by the program or holding the power to influence its fate. But it&rsquo;s not enough to simply identify them; we need to understand their &ldquo;why.&rdquo; What problems do they hope this program will solve? What opportunities does it unlock? What&rsquo;s their top priority? Through conversations and active listening, we capture these aspirations, align them with the program&rsquo;s goals, and translate them into a set of clear, measurable OKRs that become our guiding stars.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Forging the Hexad - A Leadership Crucible</strong></p><p>No program truly soars alone. That&rsquo;s why I assemble my <strong>Hexad</strong>, a carefully chosen team of six critical roles who form the program&rsquo;s backbone. It&rsquo;s more than just a program manager - this is a brain trust encompassing the Product Manager, the Sponsor, the Engineering Manager for technical ownership, the Solution and Business Architect for functional alignment, the Quality Engineer to ensure consistency across teams, and the Business Change Manager to orchestrate the human side of the transformation. Together, we co-create the program charter, a living document that maps our vision, approach, risks and dependencies, metrics, resources, and more. It&rsquo;s our North Star, guiding us through uncharted territory.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Igniting the Engines - Sponsorship and Urgency</strong></p><p>With the map drawn and the crew assembled, it&rsquo;s time to ignite the engines. We secure <strong>sponsorship</strong>, finding champions who lend their clout and voice to the program&rsquo;s cause. But sponsorship alone isn&rsquo;t enough. We need to <strong>spark urgency</strong>, a burning desire to see the program succeed. This is where I weave storytelling magic, painting a vivid picture of the problem we&rsquo;re solving and the impact we&rsquo;ll create. The air crackles with anticipation, propelling us forward.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Charting the Course - Structure, Prioritization, and Quick Wins</strong></p><p>Now, we plot the course. First, <strong>embrace agility</strong>. We break down the program into iterative cycles, constantly refining our backlog and adapting to changing landscapes. But agility isn&rsquo;t just about flexibility; it&rsquo;s about learning. That&rsquo;s where <strong>MVPs</strong> come in. We identify those &ldquo;quick wins,&rdquo; the minimum viable products that allow us to test our hypotheses and gather real-world feedback. With each iteration, we learn, we adapt, and we build momentum, proving the program&rsquo;s potential and securing buy-in for the road ahead.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Building Bridges - Collaboration and Psychological Safety</strong></p><p>No program exists in a silo. <strong>Cross-functional collaboration</strong> is the lifeblood of success. We create opportunities for engineers, designers, marketers, and business analysts to mingle, share ideas, and break down the walls between disciplines. This is where innovation truly thrives. But collaboration needs a foundation of <strong>psychological safety</strong>. We encourage open communication, embrace failure as a learning opportunity, and build trust within the team. Only then can diverse minds truly come together and achieve the extraordinary.</p><p><strong>Step 6: Anticipating the Headwinds - Identifying Roadblocks and Assumptions</strong></p><p>The road ahead is rarely smooth. That&rsquo;s why we preemptively <strong>identify potential roadblocks</strong>. Which stakeholders might create obstacles? What dependencies could derail our progress? We actively seek out these hidden pitfalls and develop mitigation plans, ensuring we&rsquo;re not blindsided by unexpected turbulence. We also challenge our own assumptions, constantly revisiting and refining our hypotheses based on new data and feedback.</p><p><strong>Step 7: The Rhythm of Success - Monitoring, Adapting, and Celebrating</strong></p><p>Launching a program is akin to conducting an orchestra. Every instrument, every team member, needs to play in perfect harmony. That&rsquo;s why we establish a <strong>regular rhythm of monitoring and adaptation</strong>. We track progress against our OKRs, analyze data, and identify areas for improvement. This constant feedback loop ensures we&rsquo;re always dancing to the music of progress, not clinging to outdated strategies.</p><p>But don&rsquo;t forget the power of <strong>celebration</strong>. Each milestone achieved, each obstacle overcome, deserves recognition. A quick shout out, a virtual high five, a team lunch – these small gestures fuel morale and remind everyone why we embarked on this journey together. Celebrating success, both big and small, keeps the fire of motivation burning bright.</p><p><strong>The Final Frontier: A Legacy of Lessons Learned</strong></p><p>As the program reaches its culmination, we don&rsquo;t simply pack up and move on. We take the time to <strong>capture the learnings</strong>, the successes and the stumbles, the insights gleaned from the trenches. These become our legacy, a treasure trove of knowledge that future programs can draw upon. By sharing our experiences, we not only elevate our own practice but also pave the way for a future where tech programs soar with even greater precision and grace.</p><p><strong>What would you add?</strong></p></div></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2023/03/2023-03-13-employing-system-thinking-to-technical-programme-management/>Employing System Thinking to Technical Programme Management</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2023/12/2023-12-18-s01e50-weeknotes-11-17-december-2023/>S01E50: #weeknotes: 11-17 December, 2023</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
