**January Reflections & February Intentions: Setting the Course for the Year**

January. The first page turned in a new chapter. It's been a month of looking both inwards and outwards, taking stock, and starting to set the course for the year ahead. As is my practice, I've been using the "**Wheel of Life**" as a framework to reflect across different areas – work, finances, health, relationships, personal growth, and more. Here’s a snapshot of January and a peek into what I'm aiming for in February.

**Career & Contribution:**

On the professional front, January felt solid. I navigated some organizational shifts, strengthened partnerships within my team, and felt a real sense of being a central contributor. It's rewarding to feel valued and effective at work. For February, the focus is on nurturing my team – investing in their development and ensuring we’re collectively ready for the changes ahead, especially with the rise of AI. I also want to dedicate time to proactively explore how AI will shape our roles and how I can lead in that space.

**Financial Wellbeing:**

Financially, January was about conscious management. We tightened our belts, navigated some unexpected expenses, and I’m proud of the financial discipline we maintained at home. February is about building on this. We’re aiming to create a bit more of a financial safety net and get smarter about avoiding those emotional spending moments when stress creeps in.

**Health & Energy:**

Health-wise, January was a mixed bag. I started strong, getting back into routines like running and mindfulness. But life's bumps and stresses did throw me off track at times, impacting my consistency. February is about resilience. Re-establishing those healthy routines is key, but even more importantly, I want to build stronger defences against stress derailing them. Mindful moments and consistent exercise, even in small doses, are the anchors I’ll be focusing on.

**Relationships – Family & Friends:**

Relationships… always the heart of it all. January brought home the importance of nurturing connections. With my family, it’s about carving out intentional quality time, especially with my little one. With friends, particularly here in the UK, I recognize the need to be more proactive in building deeper connections. February is about intentionality – date nights with my wife, dedicated playtime with my son, and actively reaching out to build friendships and stay connected with family afar.

**Personal Growth & Purpose:**

In personal growth, January was about curiosity and learning, but also recognizing a need for more self-direction. I want to ensure my growth is driven from within, not just by external tools. And underpinning everything is this deeper search for purpose. I’m starting to explore how to align my career more closely with my values and to reconnect with spiritual practices that ground me. February is about focused learning, deeper self-reflection, and taking initial steps to explore a more purposeful career path and spiritual reconnection.

**Fun & Environment:**

Finding joy and recreation in January was about appreciating small moments – nature walks, music, simple pleasures. But I also realized I need to give myself permission to just enjoy “unproductive” fun without guilt! My physical environment – our home and the nature around us – remains a real source of gratitude and wellbeing. February’s intentions here are simple: schedule in joy, savour those moments, finish the decluttering project at home, and make small improvements to our living space.

**Looking Ahead to February:**

Overall, January was about awareness – recognizing patterns, acknowledging challenges, and appreciating the positives. February is about _action_ – taking small, deliberate steps in each area to build momentum, strengthen my foundations, and move closer to a more balanced and purposeful life. It’s not about perfection, it’s about progress, and about consistently checking in with the “wheel” to ensure a smoother ride.

Onwards to February.
