## Building Infrastructure for Digital Freedom

**Status:** Early exploration - Public reveal planned for early 2026

## The Vision

In a world where our data is constantly extracted, analyzed, and monetized by corporations and governments, we've lost agency over our digital selves. 

Current "privacy" solutions are bandaids on a fundamentally extractive system:
- Browser privacy modes (still tracked)
- VPNs (shift trust to another party)
- Encrypted messaging (metadata still exposed)
- "Privacy-focused" services (still controlled by companies)

This project explores **hardware-based approaches to genuine digital autonomy** - infrastructure that puts individuals back in control.

## Why Hardware?

**Software can be compromised:**
- Backdoors added by developers or governments
- Updates that change terms or functionality
- Dependency on external services
- Single points of failure

**Hardware provides sovereignty:**
- Physical ownership and control
- Verifiable at the circuit level
- No remote updates without your consent
- Works independently of external services

## The Problem Space

**What does digital sovereignty actually mean?**

- **Data ownership:** Your data lives on infrastructure you control
- **Privacy by default:** No telemetry, no tracking, no extraction
- **Interoperability:** Works with existing systems, doesn't require everyone to switch
- **Accessibility:** Usable by non-technical people
- **Resilience:** Continues working even if services shut down

## Current Phase: Discovery & Research

**Exploring:**
- Hardware architecture approaches (edge computing, local-first design)
- Digital sovereignty protocols and standards
- User needs and pain points (who needs this most?)
- Manufacturing and distribution models
- Business model that aligns with sovereignty values

**Questions I'm working through:**
- What's the minimum viable hardware that provides meaningful sovereignty?
- How do you balance sovereignty with convenience?
- What's the price point that makes this accessible?
- How do you build a business that doesn't compromise the mission?

## Philosophy

This project aligns with my broader work on digital empowerment:

**MyDigitAlly** gives parents agency through **knowledge**  
**This project** gives individuals agency through **infrastructure**

Both stem from the same belief: people deserve control over their digital lives.

## Practicing Digital Sovereignty

This website (hareesh.co) is a small example:
- Built with Hugo (static site generator I control)
- Hosted on infrastructure I choose (Vercel, but portable)
- No tracking, no analytics harvesting
- Content stored as markdown files I own
- Can move anywhere, anytime

The hardware venture will extend these principles to a broader set of digital activities.

## Timeline

**2024-2025:** Research, prototyping, user validation  
**Early 2026:** Public reveal with working prototype  
**Mid 2026:** Initial product launch (if validation succeeds)

Updates will appear here and in my [Notes](/notes) as development progresses.

## Why I'm Building This

After spending 15+ years in digital product development, I've seen how extractive the system has become. Every product wants your data, your attention, your autonomy.

Meanwhile, I'm raising kids in this environment and building MyDigitAlly to help parents navigate it.

**The question became:** What if we had infrastructure that worked FOR individuals, not AGAINST them?

This project is my attempt to answer that.

## Related Writing

I write about digital sovereignty, privacy, and technology philosophy in my [Notes](/notes). Topics include:

- Why hardware matters for sovereignty
- Learning from existing projects (Pine64, System76, Purism)
- The business model challenge of sovereignty
- What parents actually need vs. what tech offers
