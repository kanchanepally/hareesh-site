[{"categories":["Active"],"contents":"Empowering Parents in the Digital Age MyDigitAlly is a freemium edtech startup that helps non-tech parents confidently navigate their kids\u0026rsquo; digital world.\nThe Problem Parents today face an impossible challenge: they need to guide their children through a digital landscape they don\u0026rsquo;t fully understand themselves. The pace of technological change means even tech-savvy parents struggle to keep up with new platforms, risks, and opportunities.\nMost resources are either too technical, too judgmental, or too time-consuming for busy parents.\nOur Solution We convert research-based insights into accessible, 5-minute e-learning tools that respect parents\u0026rsquo; time and meet them where they are - not where experts think they should be.\nWhat We Offer:\nWeekly automated newsletter with actionable insights Non-judgmental, research-backed guidance Quick-learning modules designed for busy schedules Custom AI assistant (in development) grounded in our curriculum using RAG + MCP Current Status Live and growing. We have an active community of parents engaging with our newsletter and learning tools.\nIn Development: AI-powered learning companion that provides personalized guidance based on individual family situations and concerns.\nThe Vision Every parent should feel confident co-piloting with their kids through the digital world. Not as experts, but as informed, engaged guides who understand the landscape well enough to have meaningful conversations.\nVisit MyDigitAlly → | Subscribe to Newsletter →\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/ventures/mydigitally_venture/","tags":["edtech","parenting","AI","education"],"title":"MyDigitAlly"},{"categories":["Exploration"],"contents":"Digital Sovereignty for Everyone An early-stage hardware venture focused on true digital sovereignty - giving individuals complete ownership and control of their digital lives.\nThe Vision In a world where our data is constantly extracted, analyzed, and monetized by corporations and governments, we\u0026rsquo;ve lost agency over our digital selves. Current \u0026ldquo;privacy\u0026rdquo; solutions are bandaids on a fundamentally extractive system.\nThis project explores hardware-based approaches to genuine digital autonomy - infrastructure that puts individuals back in control.\nCurrent Status Early exploration phase. Researching:\nHardware architecture approaches Digital sovereignty protocols User needs and pain points Manufacturing and distribution models Timeline: Aiming for public reveal in early 2026\nWhy Hardware? Software solutions can always be compromised, backdoored, or changed by external parties. Hardware provides a foundation for sovereignty that users can physically control and verify.\nPhilosophy This aligns with my broader work on digital empowerment. Just as MyDigitAlly gives parents agency through knowledge, this project aims to give individuals agency through infrastructure.\nUpdates will appear here as the project develops. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in digital sovereignty, follow along on /notes where I share thinking in this space.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/ventures/stealth_venture/","tags":["hardware","privacy","sovereignty","stealth"],"title":"Stealth Hardware Project"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hareesh Kanchanepally Portfolio Director | Founder | Expert Generalist Building digital sovereignty tools and enabling parents in the digital age.\nCurrently building MyDigitAlly (edtech startup) and exploring a stealth hardware project focused on digital sovereignty.\nAbout Me I\u0026rsquo;m a Portfolio Director, founder, and builder focused on creating tools that empower people in the digital age.\nBy Day: Leading product portfolios in agile delivery environments, focusing on prioritization, strategy, and rapid execution.\nBy Night: Building ventures at the intersection of technology, education, and digital sovereignty.\nCurrent Projects MyDigitAlly - Empowering non-tech parents to confidently navigate their kids\u0026rsquo; digital world with research-based insights and AI-powered learning tools.\nStealth Hardware Project - Early-stage exploration of hardware solutions for digital sovereignty.

I\u0026rsquo;m interested in the intersection of technology, parenting, privacy, and how we can build tools that give people more agency over their digital lives.\nI use AI-assisted development and \u0026ldquo;vibe coding\u0026rdquo; to rapidly prototype and build.
