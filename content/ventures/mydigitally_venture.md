## Empowering Parents in the Digital Age

MyDigitAlly is a freemium edtech startup that helps non-tech parents confidently navigate their kids' digital world.

### The Problem

Parents today face an impossible challenge: they need to guide their children through a digital landscape they don't fully understand themselves. The pace of technological change means even tech-savvy parents struggle to keep up with new platforms, risks, and opportunities.

Most resources are either too technical, too judgmental, or too time-consuming for busy parents.

### Our Solution

We convert research-based insights into accessible, 5-minute e-learning tools that respect parents' time and meet them where they are - not where experts think they should be.

**What We Offer:**
- Weekly automated newsletter with actionable insights
- Non-judgmental, research-backed guidance
- Quick-learning modules designed for busy schedules
- Custom AI assistant (in development) grounded in our curriculum using RAG + MCP

### Current Status

**Live and growing.** We have an active community of parents engaging with our newsletter and learning tools.

**In Development:** AI-powered learning companion that provides personalized guidance based on individual family situations and concerns.

### The Vision

Every parent should feel confident co-piloting with their kids through the digital world. Not as experts, but as informed, engaged guides who understand the landscape well enough to have meaningful conversations.
