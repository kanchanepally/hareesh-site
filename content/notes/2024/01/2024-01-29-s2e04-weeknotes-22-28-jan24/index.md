Monday morning musings, chai brewing, and the lingering echoes of weekend reflections – that's my favourite way to kick off the week. This time, however, the echoes resonate with both professional triumphs and personal introspection. Let's unpack them.

**Work Wins:**

This week was a whirlwind of collaboration, strategy, and a dash of healthy assertiveness (something I'm consciously cultivating). Aligned teams, a crystal-clear Researcher valuestream (and its next steps!), and a deep dive into effective release documentation – all in a week's work! Not to mention tackling the ever-evolving landscape of PMO leadership and interrogating the governance layers that sometimes inadvertently lead us away from the customer. It's intense, but I'm loving the momentum and the collective progress – feels like we're finally leaving 2023 in the dust!

**Personal Pitstop:**

On the home front, it was a week of Sankranthi reflections, weaving together the threads of immigration, integration, and our individual agency in this grand tapestry of life. It was beautiful, bittersweet, and definitely worth writing about (which I did!).

**Learning & Looking Ahead:**

Let's face it, I can't be everywhere at once. My ambitious hopes of coding, mindful presence, and even a sprinkle of running fell a bit short. Time management, my old nemesis, reared its head again. But hey, lessons learned! This week, I'm prioritizing with laser focus:

- **P&T Conference Support:** Cheering on our team and ensuring a smooth, impactful event.

- **2024 Objectives Deep Dive:** Documenting those goals and plans to keep us all on track.

- **PMO Taskforce Time:** Lending my expertise and pushing for positive change.

- **Content Creation Commitment:** The weekly work newsletter and monthly long-form read are calling, and I'll answer!

- **Tying Up 2024 Objectives:** It's the end of January already?! Gotta nail down those ambitions.

And, maybe in a corner of my brain, a sliver of hope for that run...

So, here's to a week of intentional action, collaborative spirit, and maybe, just maybe, a stolen jog amidst the hustle. Onward!
