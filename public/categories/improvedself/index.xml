Now, however, we all know that self-reflection is something we &amp;ldquo;need to&amp;rdquo; do, &amp;ldquo;love to&amp;rdquo; do, but at least in my case, never do it enough and/or consistently. Coincidentally, I have been a fan of the &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jonnyfwilliams/comweeknotes-2-6-january-22d7517e6ec2"&gt;weeknotes&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@jonnyfwilliams"&gt;Jonny Williams&lt;/a&gt; has been publishing throughout the last year and I found them a useful format to not only reflect but to share the notes from the world. There&amp;rsquo;s intentionality in it and also a social commitment that I love. So, here we go: here&amp;rsquo;s the first of the 2023! Oh, wishing you a happy new year, by the way (if I can still wish you on the 09th of Jan).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
