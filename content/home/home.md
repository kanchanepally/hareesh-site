# Hareesh Kanchanepally

## Portfolio Director | Founder | Expert Generalist

I lead technology portfolios and product development in agile environments, focusing on getting the right things delivered quickly. Outside work, I build tools that give people more agency in the digital world.

Currently building **[MyDigitAlly](https://mydigitally.co.uk)** - an AI-powered platform helping parents navigate their kids' digital lives with confidence. Also exploring hardware solutions for digital sovereignty (launching 2026).

I believe in building in public, shipping imperfectly, and the portfolio approach to both work and life. This site is where I share what I'm learning.

**What you'll find here:** Product development thinking, lessons from building MyDigitAlly, portfolio management approaches, and thoughts on digital sovereignty.
