Work Front: The Enterprise Software Development Rollercoaster
Persistence rings especially true in my work in product development and delivery. I continue to grapple with a set of issues that, over my 15-year career, feel both repetitive and wicked. These challenges, while engaging and intellectually stimulating, follow a cyclical pattern: a period of rapid development to meet immediate revenue goals, followed by a phase of simplification and unification. Build, then tidy—rinse and repeat."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-07-15T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-07-15T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Agile"><meta property="article:tag" content="Intentions"><meta property="article:tag" content="Reflections"><meta property="article:tag" content="Technical-Programme-Management"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tpm"><meta property="article:tag" content="Weeknotes"><meta property="og:image" content="https://hareesh.co/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>Week 27 #Weeknotes: July 8 -14, 2024</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2024-07-15T00:00:00+00:00>July 15, 2024</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><p>Despite the ongoing struggle to wrangle weekly updates, I&rsquo;m back in the saddle again.

I continue to grapple with a set of issues that, over my 15-year career, feel both repetitive and wicked. These challenges, while engaging and intellectually stimulating, follow a cyclical pattern: a period of rapid development to meet immediate revenue goals, followed by a phase of simplification and unification. Build, then tidy—rinse and repeat.</p><p>Enterprise architecture has evolved significantly, offering hope that we can break this cycle and create software that&rsquo;s both profitable, sustainable, and scalable. While iterative development churns out features, the architectural engine should propel us forward.</p><p>The &ldquo;wickedness&rdquo; of these problems lies in their complexity, interconnectedness, and lack of clear-cut solutions. Yet, despite their uniqueness, they also feel repetitive, rooted in the specific context and culture of enterprise software development.</p><p>My approach? Persistence, reflection, learning, and leaning in. Constantly zooming in and out, like a camera lens, helps me balance managing the repetitive cycle with tackling the unique challenges on the ground.</p><p><strong>Personal Front: Embracing the TDR and Literary Delights</strong></p><p>I took a couple of days off work to kickstart a total diet replacement (TDR) plan aimed at reversing my diabetes and halting peripheral neuropathy. In simpler terms, I&rsquo;ve put on a bit too much weight, and it&rsquo;s time for a change. Surprisingly, the 800-calorie-per-day diet is manageable, especially with the help of excellent decaf black coffee.</p><p>This new regime, along with a minor unrelated procedure, gave me an excuse to indulge in my love of reading. Working for a publisher provides access to an incredible variety of books, and I thoroughly enjoyed delving into the techniques of autofiction and literary theory—not too far removed from the theater of software development!</p><p><strong>Coming Week: Risk Assessment and Ruminations on Food</strong></p><p>This week, I&rsquo;ll be conducting a 360-degree risk assessment of my portfolio and brainstorming mitigation strategies ahead of an LT workshop. On the personal front, I&rsquo;ll likely be ruminating on the joys (and challenges) of an 800-calorie diet!</p><p>Let&rsquo;s see what the next week brings!</p></div></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2024/05/2024-05-20-week-20-may-13-19-2024/>Week 20, May 13-19, 2024</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2024/08/2024-08-12-week-31-weeknotes-aug-5-9-2024/>Week 31 #Weeknotes: Aug 5-9, 2024</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
