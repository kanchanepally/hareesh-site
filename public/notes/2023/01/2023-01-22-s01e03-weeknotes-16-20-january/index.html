The year 2022 concluded with the same energy and flavor as its preceding months, but 2023 carries an undercurrent of solidity and assurance. As we navigate the early weeks of this new year, several key themes have emerged, shaping my focus and approach.
Quarterly Planning: Inceptions and Construction Beginnings
The beginning is always delicate. As we embark on this quarter’s planning, Dune’s profound quote resonates deeply: “Beginnings are delicate. They must be nurtured like small flames.” We must carefully consider our goals, strategies, and resource allocation, ensuring that every initiative ignites with the potential to flourish."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2023-01-22T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2023-01-22T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Agile"><meta property="article:tag" content="Delivery"><meta property="article:tag" content="Technical-Programme-Management"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tpm"><meta property="og:image" content="https://hareesh.co/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>S01E03: #weeknotes: 16-20 January</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2023-01-22T00:00:00+00:00>January 22, 2023</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><p><strong>A Smooth Transition into 2023: Quarterly Planning, Insights, and Dune</strong></p><p>The year 2022 concluded with the same energy and flavor as its preceding months, but 2023 carries an undercurrent of solidity and assurance. As we navigate the early weeks of this new year, several key themes have emerged, shaping my focus and approach.</p><p><strong>Quarterly Planning: Inceptions and Construction Beginnings</strong></p><p>The beginning is always delicate. As we embark on this quarter&rsquo;s planning, Dune&rsquo;s profound quote resonates deeply: &ldquo;Beginnings are delicate. They must be nurtured like small flames.&rdquo; We must carefully consider our goals, strategies, and resource allocation, ensuring that every initiative ignites with the potential to flourish.</p><p><strong>The So-Called &ldquo;Agile&rdquo; Role Disappearance at Capital One</strong></p><p>A recent incident at Capital One raises concerns about the evolving nature of &ldquo;agile&rdquo; roles within organizations. While agile principles advocate for adaptability and flexibility, the disappearance of these roles suggests a potential disconnect between espoused values and actual practices. It&rsquo;s crucial to examine how organizations are truly embracing agile principles and ensuring that roles and structures support these values.</p><p><strong>Taking Sick-Off: Prioritizing Well-Being</strong></p><p>Taking a sick day may seem counterintuitive in the fast-paced world of software development, but it&rsquo;s essential for maintaining overall well-being. As we prioritize our professional commitments, it&rsquo;s equally important to acknowledge the need for rest and rejuvenation. Taking care of ourselves ensures that we can approach our work with renewed energy and focus.</p><p><strong>Key Insights, Feelings, and Actions from This Week</strong></p><p>Throughout this week, several insights, feelings, and actions have crystallized:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Probably, Just, Maybe, and Perhaps:</strong> A conversation with Chris and Richard regarding the MSC/Phase 4 combination highlighted the importance of clarity and decisiveness. Avoiding vagueness and ambiguity allows for informed decision-making and a clear path forward.</p></li><li><p><strong>Metrics and Measures:</strong> Establishing metrics and measures is crucial for tracking progress and evaluating the effectiveness of our 2023 personal/professional objectives. Data-driven insights provide valuable guidance for continuous improvement.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delegation:</strong> Delegation is a key theme for 2023, emphasizing the importance of empowering our team members to take ownership and contribute meaningfully. By sharing responsibilities, we foster a sense of empowerment and collective success.</p></li></ul><p><strong>What&rsquo;s in Store for the Next Week</strong></p><p>As we move forward into the next week, the following tasks lie ahead:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Firming up quarterly plans:</strong> Refining and finalizing our quarterly plans ensures alignment and focus throughout the organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Setting up the new portfolio:</strong> Establishing the new portfolio structure lays the groundwork for efficient project management and resource allocation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Completing performance reviews:</strong> Providing constructive feedback and recognizing achievements through performance reviews strengthens team morale and fosters growth.</p></li><li><p><strong>Delegation:</strong> Empowering our team members to take on additional responsibilities further enhances their capabilities and fosters a culture of ownership.</p></li><li><p><strong>Programme Orchestration and Governance:</strong> Implementing effective governance mechanisms ensures that all initiatives align with the overall strategic direction.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Dune: A Timeless Allegory</strong></p><p>Amidst the whirlwind of work and personal commitments, I found solace and inspiration in Frank Herbert&rsquo;s Dune. This epic sci-fi novel offers a profound exploration of power, leadership, and the human condition. The Fremen&rsquo;s resilience and unwavering commitment to their beliefs serve as a reminder of the power of determination and adaptability in the face of adversity.</p><p>As we navigate the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, let us draw strength from Dune&rsquo;s lessons, embrace our commitments, and strive to create a more sustainable and equitable future.</p></div></article><div class=single-pagination><hr><div class=flexnowrap><div class=single-pagination-prev><div class=single-pagination-container-prev><div class=single-pagination-text>←</div><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2023/01/2023-01-16-s01e02-weeknotes-9-13-january/>S01E02: #weeknotes: 9-13 January</a></div></div></div><div class=single-pagination-next><div class=single-pagination-container-next><div class=single-pagination-text><a href=/notes/2023/03/2023-03-13-employing-system-thinking-to-technical-programme-management/>Employing System Thinking to Technical Programme Management</a></div><div class=single-pagination-text>→</div></div></div></div><hr></div><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
