**Personal Reflections:**

This week was a tapestry of personal growth and introspection. Launching my [fortnightly newsletter](https://open.substack.com/pub/hareesh/p/makara-sankranti-at-our-southwest?r=cmhoq&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web) focusing on the first-gen Indian immigrant experience proved daunting. The commitment to a regular cadence felt more intimidating than starting a blog with its flexible schedule. But like any good product manager, I embraced the challenge, navigating the "oscillation and consideration of risks alongside ambitions." Now, the focus lies on marketing the newsletter and ensuring its value for both myself and my subscribers.

On a more personal note, this week brought up questions about friendship. Childhood bonds felt eternal, but some seem to require re-evaluation. Differences in values and aspirations emerge as we grow, and perhaps letting go to make room for new connections is necessary. As I approach my mid-40s, the very meaning of friendship in a foreign land becomes a subject of much pondering. In this exploration, I find joy in writing, using it as a tool to process thoughts and share them through the newsletter. This aligns with Heidegger's idea of tools; writing is mine and I use it as a mirror reflecting and clarifying the world around us. Another source of joy was spending time with my five-year-old Robin, cooking together and cherishing our home. We feel incredibly fortunate for these moments.

**Professional Strides:**

The professional front saw positive progress. Collaborating with colleagues, we reviewed team objectives, clarified processes for [release retrospectives](http://hareesh.co/2024/02/07/conducting-program-release-retrospectives/), and defined next steps for key initiatives. [Goldratt's theory of constraints](https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html) remained at the forefront of these discussions, guiding us towards identifying and addressing bottlenecks efficiently.

**Looking Ahead:**

The second week of February brings its own set of goals:

- Finalising team performance reviews and personal objectives for 2024.

- Focusing on the remaining PMO leadership goals for the next two months.

- Actively marketing the [Des/Pardes](https://hareesh.substack.com?utm_source=navbar&utm_medium=web&r=cmhoq) newsletter. (Subscribe to it!!)

- And achieving that elusive "run!"
