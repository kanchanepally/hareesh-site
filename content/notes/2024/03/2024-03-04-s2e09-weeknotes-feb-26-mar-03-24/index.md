2024 is already rolling, and this past week provided a handful of experiences that will definitely stick with me. Let's jump right in!

**[SOFEA](https://www.sofea.uk.com) and the community spirit:** My organisation, [Informa](https://www.informa.com/sustainability/community-impact/), runs a fantastic initiative by offering employees four days of paid volunteer leave to contribute to a cause of their choice. As we began the year, I looked for ways our technical program management team could bond outside of work. Brainstorming another project solution didn't feel right, so using a day to support a local charity was a clear choice.

SOFEA, located next door to our Oxford office, perfectly fit the bill. They provide a safe space for young adults who don't conform to traditional educational structures. It's a place where they can be themselves, build self-esteem, and contribute to something meaningful. They partner with [FareShare](https://fareshare.org.uk/), the food charity, and do a lot of work to sort, store, and distribute food to the local communities. Throughout the day, Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall" kept playing in my head, reflecting the impact SOFEA has on these young people. The experience itself deserves a dedicated post, but it also served as a fantastic team-building exercise. We came away feeling connected to something bigger than ourselves and united by our shared act of kindness.

**Overnight in London**: I then went onto stay overnight at London, had a brief dabble at [Whitechapel gallery](https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/), a dose of diaspora with a [chai and curry](https://www.chaiiwala.co.uk/) at [Brick Lane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Lane), and on tube to the lovely [YHA Thameside](https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/yha-london-thameside?utm_source=google&utm_medium=maps&utm_campaign=google-places). I just cannot imagine staying in a hotel when there's a YHA around. It's such a strange thing for me when some balks at the idea that I was staying at YHA rather than a hotel.

This trip to Brick Lane, after over a decade, revealed a different side to the area. Layers of foreign culture were evident, and I experienced a strange feeling of being an outsider, despite being in an East Indian curry house. Displacement was palpable, with local vendors eagerly inviting Western customers while seemingly ignoring me. Coincidentally, I was reading "[Identity and Violence](https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/amartya-sen-fba/identity-and-violence/9780141027807?cq_src=google_ads&cq_cmp=19545754695&cq_con=&cq_med=pla&cq_plac=&cq_net=x&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU76Qy0icvk-lpzTNaqs9QcgJGntOG5IWbKqNBiXwuU1qxuxZb8YQW5RoCGm0QAvD_BwE#GOR002561033)" by Amartya Sen during the journey, which added an unexpected layer of relevance to the experience.

**Professional Reflections:**

On the professional front, this week also provided opportunities for reflection. I've outlined four key areas I want to focus on this year:

- **Increase Assertive Participation:** I will actively seek opportunities to share my ideas and insights in various forums.

- **Expand Tech Stack Knowledge:** I will actively seek opportunities to deepen my understanding of the technology stack, enabling better resource allocation and more informed technical discussions.

- **Drive Common TPM Best Practice:** I will champion and advocate for the use of established best practices within the team, collaborating closely with other teams to ensure implementation.

- **Enhance Peer Feedback Skills:** I will actively seek training or resources to refine my skills in providing constructive and actionable feedback, empowering colleagues to elevate their performance and contribute more effectively.

- **Strengthen Product Sense:** I will dedicate time and energy to honing my product management skills, particularly in the areas of pricing, growth, and go-to-market strategies.

**Looking Ahead:**

I'm finalising a couple of user guides for TPMs that I believe will be very helpful, and I'm excited to share the first one this week. Additionally, I've been invited to participate in shaping our organization's new structure. It's an exciting yet daunting prospect, and I'm eager to get started.

See you next week!
