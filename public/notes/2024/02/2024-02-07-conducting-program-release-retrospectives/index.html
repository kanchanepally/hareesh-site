<a class=anchor href=#what>#</a></h2><ul><li><p><strong>Release/Project Retrospectives:</strong> Focus on a broader scope, encompassing the entire release cycle from planning to execution and post-launch support (aka warranty/hypercare). They involve a larger group of stakeholders, including cross-functional teams, development, operations, and external partners as needed. Often Product teams could represent these “external” colleagues’ views, but I have found that it’s often useful to have them included to learn from them directly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lessons Learnt:</strong> As the name suggests, these workshops tend to focus on what went wrong and what we can learn from those mistakes. I find these a bit negative.  I like the word “retrospective” as it helps broaden our purview and invites acknowledging wins as well as lessons. It’s as important to build on why something successful as we delve in why something didn’t go as planned.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sprint Retrospectives:</strong> Address shorter iterations within a release, typically lasting 1-4 weeks. They concentrate on team dynamics, working practices, and improvement within the specific sprint, involving the immediate development team.</p></li></ul><h2 class=heading id=conducting-a-release-retrospective--a-tried-and-tested-framework><strong>Conducting a release retrospective – a “tried and tested” framework</strong>
<a class=anchor href=#conducting-a-release-retrospective--a-tried-and-tested-framework>#</a></h2><p>The framework below can be – to be honest – applied to any brainstorming exercise.  I have used it seek ideas on how we can go remote working, to determine the objectives for a programme, and so on. The framework uses a cycle that allows for learnings from cognitive psychology and how our brains work, especially in a team environment.  During a release retrospective when there might be many stakeholders, I found this approach much more useful than a more simplistic, “<em>what went well, what didn’t go well, actions</em>” framework.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Prep</strong>: Release retros often involve cross-functional teams, stakeholders, DevOps, Service, and product tech support teams. It’s many people, so the more off-line work you can do, the better. Have face-to-face sessions, or surveys if remote, to get a sense of the key themes that are emerging. Read the room before you get everyone involved. This would enable you to prep the workshop effectively and have some volunteers recruited accordingly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Temp check</strong>: As people join the retro, set the scene, highlight the overall objective of the release, flash back on the key events upto the hypercare, provide factual details as to what transpired.  Jog the memory, but steer clear of any judgemental or subjective commentary.  Here, we’re enabling folk to warm up to sharing their thoughts without steering them to one direction. Be brief.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gather data</strong>: Ask one rep from each team/discipline to represent their team to post their comments on what went well, what didn’t go well, what could have been different, and so on. Keep it time bound. This is a therapeutic exercise of just emptying the proverbial bag on the table.</p></li><li><p><strong>Generate themes:</strong> Go by each post-it/comment/note into themes. These could be about ways of working, documentation, tooling, project phase: let the data guide you, but your pre-work should enable you to form certain themes beforehand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Prioritise the themes:</strong> Now do a voting exercise to identify which theme you would want to focus on. For eg. if the emergent themes were project phases, and you have more tickets/pressing items against “inception” phase, you could choose that. Or if there’s a theme around “system design/solution architecture” theme, you can focus on that.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identify solutions/learnings, actions, owners</strong>: Now that you’re focusing on the theme, it’s finally the time to discuss what has gone on in that theme. As I mentioned above, balance between the good and the not-so-good. Aim is here to distil the number of tickets into actionable learnings. I often found that the entire theme of double-digit post-its yield a couple of key learnings or takeaways. For each takeaway, craft a statement that is actionable – what’s that you’d do because of that discussion.</p></li><li><p><strong>Repeat</strong> Step 6 for other themes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Closing the Retrospective</strong>: Recap key takeaways, express gratitude, and outline follow-up actions.</p></li></ol><h2 class=heading id=sample-activities-for-each-stage><strong>Sample Activities for Each Stage:</strong>
