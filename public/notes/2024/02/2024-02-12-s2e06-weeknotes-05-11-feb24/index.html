Childhood bonds felt eternal, but some seem to require re-evaluation. Differences in values and aspirations emerge as we grow, and perhaps letting go to make room for new connections is necessary. As I approach my mid-40s, the very meaning of friendship in a foreign land becomes a subject of much pondering. In this exploration, I find joy in writing, using it as a tool to process thoughts and share them through the newsletter. This aligns with Heidegger&rsquo;s idea of tools; writing is mine and I use it as a mirror reflecting and clarifying the world around us. Another source of joy was spending time with my five-year-old Robin, cooking together and cherishing our home. We feel incredibly fortunate for these moments.</p><p><strong>Professional Strides:</strong></p><p>The professional front saw positive progress. Collaborating with colleagues, we reviewed team objectives, clarified processes for <a href=http://hareesh.co/2024/02/07/conducting-program-release-retrospectives/>release retrospectives</a>, and defined next steps for key initiatives. <a href=https://www.tocinstitute.org/theory-of-constraints.html>Goldratt&rsquo;s theory of constraints</a> remained at the forefront of these discussions, guiding us towards identifying and addressing bottlenecks efficiently.</p><p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong></p><p>The second week of February brings its own set of goals:</p><ul><li><p>Finalising team performance reviews and personal objectives for 2024.</p></li><li><p>Focusing on the remaining PMO leadership goals for the next two months.</p></li><li><p>Actively marketing the <a href="https://hareesh.substack.com?utm_source=navbar&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;r=cmhoq">Des/Pardes</a> newsletter.
