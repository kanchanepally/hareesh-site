Crikey, this week’s been good, both at the office and at home. Let’s unpack the highlights:
The Work Front
Nearly 5-ish months in the deep end covering for my boss, Vice-President, PMO – what a ride! I’ve been reflecting on the impact I’ve made and how to keep that momentum going across different projects.
Speaking of big-picture stuff, we’ve kicked off the 3-year planning exercise. This is essentially a roadmap for the next three years, helping us chart our course and prioritise initiatives. Companies do this for a few reasons: to anticipate future trends, ensure alignment across departments, and make sure we’re all rowing in the same direction. The process itself usually involves a mix of top-down direction and bottom-up input – think strategy sessions with senior leadership and feedback loops from individual teams."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-03-18T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-03-18T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="3-Year-Planning"><meta property="article:tag" content="Agile"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tags/British-Village-Life"><meta property="article:tag" content="Focus"><meta property="article:tag" content="Governance"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tags/Headlesschicken"><meta property="og:image" content="https://hareesh.co/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=https://hareesh.co/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>S2E11 #Weeknotes Mar 11-17 '24</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2024-03-18T00:00:00+00:00>March 18, 2024</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><figure><p><a href=https://hareesh.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pexels-photo.jpg><figure><div class=img-container style=--w:1880;--h:1253><img loading=lazy alt src=/notes/2024/03/2024-03-18-s2e11-weeknotes-mar-11-17-24/images/pexels-photo.jpg width=1880 height=1253></div></figure></a></p><figcaption><p>Photo by Mihis Alex on <a href=https://www.pexels.com/photo/black-toy-car-on-world-map-paper-21014/>Pexels.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Crikey, this week&rsquo;s been good, both at the office and at home. Let&rsquo;s unpack the highlights:</p><p><strong>The Work Front</strong></p><p>Nearly 5-ish months in the deep end covering for my boss, Vice-President, PMO – what a ride! I&rsquo;ve been reflecting on the impact I&rsquo;ve made and how to keep that momentum going across different projects.</p><p>Speaking of big-picture stuff, we&rsquo;ve kicked off the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesbusinesscouncil/2023/03/16/three-keys-to-creating-a-strong-business-plan-in-2023/?sh=2778cf1058bd">3-year planning exercise</a>. This is essentially a roadmap for the next three years, helping us <a href=https://asana.com/resources/strategic-planning>chart our course</a> and prioritise initiatives. Companies do this for a few reasons: to anticipate future trends, ensure alignment across departments, and make sure we&rsquo;re all rowing in the same direction. The process itself usually involves a mix of top-down direction and bottom-up input – think strategy sessions with senior leadership and feedback loops from individual teams.</p><p>Wrapping up Q1, we&rsquo;re reviewing the status of key H1, 2024 deliverables. It&rsquo;s all hands on deck to make sure we hit those targets. 96% of those are on-track for H1 completion - not a bad going for a tough year, but I know it&rsquo;s a long-way to go and a number of hurdles to get past.</p><p>One area I&rsquo;ve been focusing on is streamlining processes without adding extra hoops to jump through. For example, we have a limited number of architects, and some folks are debating how to prioritise their workload. Instead of creating a whole new approval process, could we empower engineering managers to handle some of the solution architecture work, especially for smaller initiatives?</p><p><strong>Beyond the Office</strong></p><p>The second parent meeting at school was a cracker! The teacher was absolutely delighted with our little one&rsquo;s progress – a right proud moment for a parent, that&rsquo;s for sure. It made me think back to the brave decision we made to move to a new village where we didn&rsquo;t know a soul. We took a bit of a gamble, but seeing how well our son has settled in - made friends and everything – feels like we&rsquo;ve landed on our feet. Talk about beginner&rsquo;s luck!</p><p>Speaking of taking a plunge, swimming has become a real joy lately. I was a bit fixated on speed, but then I watched that film about the lady who swam from Cuba to Florida (<a href=https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/81447231>NYAD</a>, right?). It reminded me that my original goal was simply to be able to swim a mile for surfing. Back to basics it is!</p><p>One thing that keeps cropping up in these weekly reflections is the need for focus. I still feel like I&rsquo;m running around like a <a href=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34198390>headless chicken</a> sometimes, time just slipping through my fingers.</p><p><strong>Alright, folks, eleven weeks in and I must be honest – is this working?</strong> These #weeknotes and regular reflections keep circling back to the same themes – focus, taking a step back, intent, the whole shebang. Is it the timing, or am I just spinning my wheels here? Maybe I need to tweak the format, change the timing to Monday morning, or maybe there&rsquo;s something else entirely going on. What do you think? How can I make the most of these reflections?</p></div></article><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
