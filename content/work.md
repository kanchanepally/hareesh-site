## Approach & Philosophy

**Expert Generalist Mindset:**
I move fluidly between strategic portfolio planning and tactical product execution. I can speak technical architecture with engineers, business strategy with executives, and customer value with product teams. This breadth enables me to see connections others miss and deliver integrated solutions.

**Delivery Focus:**
I prioritize ruthlessly and ship relentlessly. Complex problems get broken into manageable increments. Stakeholders get clear visibility. Teams get unblocked. Products get delivered.

**Building Culture:**
The best outcomes come from empowered teams working transparently toward shared goals. I invest in people, processes, and culture alongside products.

**Continuous Learning:**
Technology and business contexts evolve constantly. I stay current by building (see [Ventures](/ventures)), learning from teams, and maintaining hands-on technical understanding.
