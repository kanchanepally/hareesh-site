2024 is already rolling, and this past week provided a handful of experiences that will definitely stick with me. Let’s jump right in!
SOFEA and the community spirit: My organisation, Informa, runs a fantastic initiative by offering employees four days of paid volunteer leave to contribute to a cause of their choice. As we began the year, I looked for ways our technical program management team could bond outside of work. Brainstorming another project solution didn’t feel right, so using a day to support a local charity was a clear choice."><meta property="og:locale" content="en_gb"><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="article:section" content="notes"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2024-03-04T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2024-03-04T00:00:00+00:00"><meta property="article:tag" content="Acculturation"><meta property="article:tag" content="Agile"><meta property="article:tag" content="Assimilation"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tags/Bricklane"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tags/Charity"><meta property="article:tag" content="Tags/Curry"><meta property="og:image" content="http://localhost:1313/img/og-img.png"><link rel=stylesheet href=/assets/combined.min.57df9e7d692553f966cff4593ede6b53efb74da234876bacffeac774bd572e53.css media=all></head><body class=auto><div class=content><header><div class=header><h1 class=header-title><a href=http://localhost:1313/>Hareesh Kanchanepally</a></h1><div class=header-menu><p class=small><a href=/now>/now</a></p><p class=small><a href=/ventures>/ventures</a></p><p class=small><a href=/work>/work</a></p><p class=small><a href=/notes>/notes</a></p><p class=small><a href=/about>/about</a></p></div></div></header><main class=main><div><article><header class=single-intro-container><h1 class=single-title>S2E09 #Weeknotes Feb 26-Mar 03, '24</h1><div class=single-subsummary><div><p class=single-date><time datetime=2024-03-04T00:00:00+00:00>March 4, 2024</time></p></div></div></header><div class=single-content><figure><p><a href=https://hareesh.co/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pexels-photo-1187086.jpeg><figure><div class=img-container style=--w:1880;--h:1253><img loading=lazy alt src=/notes/2024/03/2024-03-04-s2e09-weeknotes-feb-26-mar-03-24/images/pexels-photo-1187086.jpeg width=1880 height=1253></div></figure></a></p><figcaption><p>Photo by Cori Emmalea Rodriguez on <a href=https://www.pexels.com/photo/people-taking-a-photo-1187086/>Pexels.com</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>2024 is already rolling, and this past week provided a handful of experiences that will definitely stick with me. Let&rsquo;s jump right in!</p><p><strong><a href=https://www.sofea.uk.com>SOFEA</a> and the community spirit:</strong> My organisation, <a href=https://www.informa.com/sustainability/community-impact/>Informa</a>, runs a fantastic initiative by offering employees four days of paid volunteer leave to contribute to a cause of their choice. As we began the year, I looked for ways our technical program management team could bond outside of work. Brainstorming another project solution didn&rsquo;t feel right, so using a day to support a local charity was a clear choice.</p><p>SOFEA, located next door to our Oxford office, perfectly fit the bill. They provide a safe space for young adults who don&rsquo;t conform to traditional educational structures. It&rsquo;s a place where they can be themselves, build self-esteem, and contribute to something meaningful. They partner with <a href=https://fareshare.org.uk/>FareShare</a>, the food charity, and do a lot of work to sort, store, and distribute food to the local communities. Throughout the day, Pink Floyd&rsquo;s &ldquo;Another Brick in the Wall&rdquo; kept playing in my head, reflecting the impact SOFEA has on these young people. The experience itself deserves a dedicated post, but it also served as a fantastic team-building exercise. We came away feeling connected to something bigger than ourselves and united by our shared act of kindness.</p><p><strong>Overnight in London</strong>: I then went onto stay overnight at London, had a brief dabble at <a href=https://www.whitechapelgallery.org/>Whitechapel gallery</a>, a dose of diaspora with a <a href=https://www.chaiiwala.co.uk/>chai and curry</a> at <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brick_Lane>Brick Lane</a>, and on tube to the lovely <a href="https://www.yha.org.uk/hostel/yha-london-thameside?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=maps&amp;utm_campaign=google-places">YHA Thameside</a>. I just cannot imagine staying in a hotel when there&rsquo;s a YHA around. It&rsquo;s such a strange thing for me when some balks at the idea that I was staying at YHA rather than a hotel.</p><p>This trip to Brick Lane, after over a decade, revealed a different side to the area. Layers of foreign culture were evident, and I experienced a strange feeling of being an outsider, despite being in an East Indian curry house. Displacement was palpable, with local vendors eagerly inviting Western customers while seemingly ignoring me. Coincidentally, I was reading &ldquo;<a href="https://www.wob.com/en-gb/books/amartya-sen-fba/identity-and-violence/9780141027807?cq_src=google_ads&amp;cq_cmp=19545754695&amp;cq_con=&amp;cq_med=pla&amp;cq_plac=&amp;cq_net=x&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA_5WvBhBAEiwAZtCU76Qy0icvk-lpzTNaqs9QcgJGntOG5IWbKqNBiXwuU1qxuxZb8YQW5RoCGm0QAvD_BwE#GOR002561033">Identity and Violence</a>&rdquo; by Amartya Sen during the journey, which added an unexpected layer of relevance to the experience.</p><p><strong>Professional Reflections:</strong></p><p>On the professional front, this week also provided opportunities for reflection. I&rsquo;ve outlined four key areas I want to focus on this year:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increase Assertive Participation:</strong> I will actively seek opportunities to share my ideas and insights in various forums.</p></li><li><p><strong>Expand Tech Stack Knowledge:</strong> I will actively seek opportunities to deepen my understanding of the technology stack, enabling better resource allocation and more informed technical discussions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Drive Common TPM Best Practice:</strong> I will champion and advocate for the use of established best practices within the team, collaborating closely with other teams to ensure implementation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhance Peer Feedback Skills:</strong> I will actively seek training or resources to refine my skills in providing constructive and actionable feedback, empowering colleagues to elevate their performance and contribute more effectively.</p></li><li><p><strong>Strengthen Product Sense:</strong> I will dedicate time and energy to honing my product management skills, particularly in the areas of pricing, growth, and go-to-market strategies.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Looking Ahead:</strong></p><p>I&rsquo;m finalising a couple of user guides for TPMs that I believe will be very helpful, and I&rsquo;m excited to share the first one this week. Additionally, I&rsquo;ve been invited to participate in shaping our organization&rsquo;s new structure. It&rsquo;s an exciting yet daunting prospect, and I&rsquo;m eager to get started.</p><p>See you next week!</p></div></article><div class=back-to-top><a href=#top>back to top</a></div></div></main></div><footer><p></p></footer></body><script src=/js/theme-switch.js></script><script defer src=/js/copy-code.js></script></html>
